Implementation of the "Heap-sort" and "Counting-sort" sorting algorithms.
Evaluation of execution times and comparison of the computational complexity between the two algorithms.
Computational complexity comparison between heap-sort implemented personally and the version implemented with the functions provided by the standard C ++ library.
